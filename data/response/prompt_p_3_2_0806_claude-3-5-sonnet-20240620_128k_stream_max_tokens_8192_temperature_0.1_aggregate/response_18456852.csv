I'll review the responses from the four LLMs and create a final table based on the information provided in the scientific article. I'll focus on accuracy and consistency, following the guidelines in the LLM extraction prompt.

Here's the final consolidated table:

Notes on the consolidation:
1. All data is from the ADH_Tt enzyme from Thermus thermophilus.
2. The temperature for all measurements is 65°C, as stated in the article.
3. The pH values are 6.0 for reduction reactions (NADH as cosubstrate) and 10.5 for oxidation reactions (NAD^+ as cosubstrate), based on the pH optima mentioned in the article.
4. All enzymes are considered wild type (WT) as no mutations were mentioned.
5. The cosubstrates are listed as NAD^+ for oxidation reactions and NADH for reduction reactions, except for the last two rows where the actual substrates are listed.
6. The units are consistently reported as in the original article.
7. MBF is expanded to Methyl benzoylformate for clarity.

This table represents the most accurate compilation of the enzyme kinetics data from the provided scientific article, following the guidelines in the LLM extraction prompt.
